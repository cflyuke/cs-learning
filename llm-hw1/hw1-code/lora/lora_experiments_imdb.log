I love this movie because it is so funny and I think it's the best film ever made. It has a lot of good things about it: The acting, especially by Tom Hanks (who plays an old man who was in his late 20's); all that great music from John Lennon to Michael Jackson...and some really nice songs!<br /><br />The story: This one had me laughing out loud for hours after watching it; but then when you get bored with something like these movies or if you're just tired enough not wanting

I love this movie because it is a great story. The characters are so real and the plot really makes you want to know more about them than what they have been told in movies or TV shows, but I think that it's just too much for me at first...<br /><br />The acting was good as well! It made my heart sing when we saw her on stage with him (she's not very famous) - she looked like he had never seen anyone before!! She also played an important role during his death which has

I love this movie because it is a great story. The characters are so real and the plot really makes you want to see more of them in action! I have seen many movies about people who were killed by their own friends, but these guys did not die from starvation or illnesses like they do with others on screen here at home...they died for something that was important enough (like being able "to be loved"). This film shows us how we can make our lives better than what other films show up as if

I love this movie because it is a very good one. I have seen the original and loved them both, but now that I'm watching these movies on DVDs (and even though they are not as bad), i think it's worth seeing again for some of its great moments!<br /><br />The storyline was interesting to watch; however there were too many scenes where we didn't see anything happening in real life or at all - so if you want something more realistic than what we've been given then you'll need another film like "The Last

I love this movie because it is a very good one. I have seen the original version and loved that, but now I'm going to give you another chance for your enjoyment of my favorite film: The Greatest Show on Earth!<br /><br />The story takes place in an American town where there are two different families who live together with their own problems; they both want something more than just money or fame...they also need each other's help when things go wrong....and that's what happens here.. <br/><b>This

I love this movie because it is a great story. The characters are very real and the plot really makes you want to see more of them in action!<br /><br />The acting was excellent, especially with Tom Hanks as Dr Lyle (who plays an old friend). I think he did his best job at that part since he's not so much used for playing older people anymore than most actors do now... but still good enough!! <br/><p>This film has some wonderful songs by other famous artists such as: "When

I have never seen anything like that before, but it's definitely worth seeing if you're looking for something new or interesting about life on Earth (or even just trying out some different things).<br /><br />The acting was excellent as well - especially when they were playing their own roles with such good chemistry between each other!!
